    <h3>HiKo: The Blogger</h3>
    <p>
        I'm HiKo. Visit <a href="http://hgao.net">my homepage</a> for details and find me on social networks.
    </p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        I begin to use <a href="http://blog.hgao.net">blog.hgao.net</a> as the domain of the blog, and <a href="http://hgao.net">hgao.net</a> is used to introduce myself. (2016.04)

        It's less than a month since I updated the secion last time, but yes, I migrate the site to DigitalOcean. I'd very much appreciate it if you could click the <a href="https://m.do.co/c/a383f1ca8bde">ref link</a>. The blog is generated by <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> now, instead of Jekyll. (2016.01)

    <p>
        The website came online in June, 2015. At first it was just a blog generated by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but now I'll put other widgets here. The site is hosted on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. Thanks to my friend <a href="http://gaocegege.com">gaocegege</a>, who told me such a cool way of deploying a static site. (2016.01)

    <h3>Name</h3>
    <p>
        The idea of The Great Garage comes from a Japanese word - Kaku Nō Kō (<ruby><rb>格</rb><rt>かく</rt></ruby><ruby><rb>納</rb><rt>のう</rt></ruby><ruby><rb>庫</rb><rt>こ</rt></ruby>), which is often used in my favorite game Super Robot Wars (SRW). All robots are stored, fixed, and updated in Kaku Nō Kō, and I hope this site will be a Kaku Nō Kō of enjoyable, memorable and helpful things.

        As for myself, <i>HiKo</i> is an experimental alias used to hide my real name. It helps me to experience an annoymous online life for now. It's origin is the abbreviation and the Japanese pronunciation of my Chinese name. I don't think it interesting.

    <h3>The Blog</h3>
    <p>
        Previously I write mainly about technology and programming, but actually more articles about my hobbies, thinking and daily trivia now.</p>
    <p>
        I may not update solutions to LeetCode because it's not very efficient to post codes here. They will be maintained on <a href="https://github.com/hikoship/LeetCode">my GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I write both in Chinese and English. (Mainly in Chinese now - 2016.8)
    </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
        Migrate the site from Jekyll to Hugo, from GitHub Pages to DigitalOcean (a painful conversion). It uses skeleton CSS framework and font-awesome icons. (2016.01)

    <p>
        A new theme has been used in the site. It is modified from Prologue designed by <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>. Maybe work badly under IE 9 and lower versions. (2016.01)

        The theme of TGG is written by myself, but I borrowed many design styles from <a href="http://apple4us.com/">apple4us.com</a>. Thank them. It's a fantastic site. TGG also uses elements of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>. Thanks to them. Meanwhile, I'm still trying to modify the theme. It's far from perfect. (2015.06)
