### [Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊ n/2 ⌋` times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Special thanks to [@ts](https://oj.leetcode.com/discuss/user/ts) for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

### Solution

A concise but highly-skilled problem. I put it aside for about a month because I have no idea after seeing its tags (divide-and-conquer, bit manipulation), but find the most trivial way to solve it tonight.

First, do a sort to the given array; Second, return the element in the middle. It's over. The majority element must be the median of the array. Otherwise, it must lie on one side of the median, which means the number of its appearance is less than `⌊ n/2 ⌋`.

    class Solution:
    # @param {integer[]} nums
    # @return {integer}
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        return nums[len(nums) / 2]

It has O(nlogn) time complexity, and can be improved to O(n). One method is called [Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm).

# solution of Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm
class Solution:
    # @param {integer[]} nums
    # @return {integer}
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        candidate = nums[0]
        count = 0
        for x in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = x
                count += 1
            else:
                if candidate == x:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count -= 1

        return candidate

Why does it work? [Here](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~wim/pub/whh348.pdf) is a mathematical proof.
